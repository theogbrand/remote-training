Start by doing some basic stretching and gradually move onto more advanced stretching techniques. Also, consider adding some yoga into your routine to further enhance your flexibility. Additionally, work on improving your balance and stability by practicing standing on one leg. This will help you become more comfortable with shifting your weight and maintaining your balance. Finally, don't forget to incorporate some strength training into your routine. Start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you become stronger.
